-- | Because we want to respond to events from the signup form, we need to have
-- | internal message representation for our top-level application. As it
-- | stands, we only care about login attempts.

-- | We export from the SignUp module as a delegate, so when we embed the html
-- | elsewhere, we only really need to say how to convert our inputs into its
-- | inputs, and its outputs into our messages. These are the only channels for
-- | communication between a delegate and its parent.

-- | At the top level, we've nothing to emit here (because we don't have some
-- | containing listener such as React). All we do is dispatch updates to the
-- | SignUp form, which we can fake for the demo.
